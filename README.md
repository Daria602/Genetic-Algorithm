# Genetic Algorithm
> This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.([source](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3#:~:text=A%20genetic%20algorithm%20is%20a,offspring%20of%20the%20next%20generation.))
## <br>
## Usage
Download the `genetic.py` and `input.txt`.<br>
The `output.txt` will be created, but only with the first round of the algorithm (selection,crossover and mutation).
For the rest of the rounds it just prints the fittest individual and the average fitness for the population.
